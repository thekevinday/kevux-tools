Open Standard License 1.0 (Informal Draft version 0.5).
  March 2022.

This is an informal document representing the not yet formalized Open Standard License 1.0.
This license applies to the Standards and their Specifications and designates legal requirements on Implementations of the Standard and their respective Specifications.

Terminology:
- Standard: A set of rules and guidelines.
- Specification: A specific interpretation or clarification of a Standard, such as the documentation that describes how to use or follow a Standard.
- Implementation: The applying of some Standard or Specification.
- API: Application Programming Interface*.
- ABI: Application Binary Interface**.
- Service: Any action or labor performed by one party for another party (such as one person helping another person).
- Protocol: In the context of computers and software, this is a Standard focused on communication between two parties (often referring to Internet communication).

* The API term is commonly mis-represented as Services or Protocols (such as "Web API").
  An API instructs a programmer how to use a dependency when programming some software that utilizes said dependency.
  An API is a Specification of some Implementation of a Standard be it a formally defined standard or an informally defined standard.
  An API may be an Implementation of a Standard or a part of an Implementation of a Standard.
  An API is, in effect, documentation.

** The ABI term refers to an Application Binary Interface and represents the compiled implementation of some API.
  An ABI may not always exist for some API, such as for pure scripting languages.
  An ABI is neither a Specification nor a Standard.
  An ABI is an Implementation of an API making it an Implementation of a Standard or Specification.

Principles of the license:
  - The Standard or Specification must be freely and publicly available to use and implement.
  - All patents associated must be royalty-free for unrestricted use and must not impose any restrictions on any third party's implementation of this Standard beyond those described in the license.
  - There must be no agreements or requirements for the execution of the license grant, including: NDA, grant, click-through, or any form of paperwork (including all non-paper forms of paperwork, such as digital forms).
  - There must be no restrictions on the form of an Implementation of a Standard or Specification.
  - The license shall prohibit any form of restricting any parties access to use, implement, extend, or deviate from this standard unless:
    - Restricted by this license.
    - Unless there is a breach of license conditions.
  - The license is irrevocable unless there is a breach of the license conditions.
  - The license does not grant any kind of warranty or liability under any circumstances to any party for any reason, be it direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, or in any other form.
  - The license does not restrict any party from optionally providing their own warranty or liability on some Implementation but such warranties or liabilities are completely separate and independent of this license.
